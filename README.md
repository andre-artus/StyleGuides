Project Style Guides
============
A collection of style guides for standardizing code formatting, naming, organization,
and other general styles across projects. These are not intended to be absolute however
if a particular project doesn't follow the defined styles it should have a section in
the README.md that lists the changes and why.


Adding Languages or Platforms
--------
Each new style guide should be located underneath a folder indicating the platform and language
(e.g. `android/kotlin/` or `android/java`). If there are style guides that are shared across
platforms (e.g. `android/java` and `backend/java`) the secondary platform should link to the primary
in the main style README.
